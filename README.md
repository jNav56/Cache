# Cache_Memory_Simulator

In this project, I implement a cache memory simulator and then use the cache simulation to optimize a matrix transpositon in trans.c. The overall feature of the simulator in csim.c is to imitate teh behavior of a hit/miss mechanic often seen in memory implementations and keep track of all the evictions, misses, and hits. I also explore the replacement policies such as least-recently-used, least-frequently-used, and size-based replacement policies. Next I involve a transpose function that works with 2 or more matrices inverting each matrix, creating a new matrix, or accessing data. The cache simulator makes the functions for the matrices more efficient. 

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in C
- Created and Utilized Cache Memory functions 
- Created and Utilized simple implementations of malloc 

## Computer Architecture Class

This course widened my proficiency in the low-level abstractions that most computers operate under the hood. I learned the many pieces of hardware that a computer has and how they interact with each other, how a computer handles arithmetic, the process of execution, and how information is stored and accessed. I had more hands on assignments dealing with Instruction Set Architecture and assembly language, pipelining, caches, and optimization techniques. All in all, the course provided a coherent guide to the architecture design of computers.
